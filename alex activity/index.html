        <h1>Ferrari Recap 2025</h1>
        <br>
        <p>What many Tifosi hoped for this season seemed a step too far out of reach: to win a championship. We are looking back on a season that left people wondering what happened to the once mighty scarlet Ferrari.</p>
        
        <p>The 2025 season will be remembered as the year of "the great anti-climax" in Maranello. After a 2024 campaign that saw the Scuderia pushing McLaren to the brink, the arrival of Lewis Hamilton was supposed to be the final piece of the championship puzzle. Instead, it became a year of profound technical frustration and "what-ifs."</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Highlights</h1>
        <img src="Lewis-Hamilton-Ferrari-Chinese-GP.webp" alt="Pole Position">
        <br>
        <p>Ferrari seemed to have a season that left many tifosi disappointed. However, they still managed to get 7 podiums and a pole position. During the sprint weekends, Lewis Hamilton did get a win, but he did not manage to translate it to a Grand Prix victory. For the team from Maranello, Charles’s pole position in Hungary was one of the highlights of this season, showing that they were not done fighting for their spot at the top. Next to this, just Lewis Hamilton wearing red was a highlight for the team and many Tifosi alike. Prior to the season, the team managed to secure one of the biggest racing legends the sport has ever seen, and even though he has not gotten on the podium yet, having a legend like Lewis Hamilton race for you is a highlight of its own.</p>
        
         <h1>Struggles</h1>
            <img src="lewis-hamilton-ferrari.jpg" alt="Pole Position">
        <br>
        <p>Even though they came fourth in the Constructors’ Championship, Ferrari seemingly had a season of nightmares with their car being unreliable and bouncing and weak team strategy leaving much to be desired. Because of this, Ferrari could not manage a repeat of their previous year where they put their fast and strong drivers on the top of the podium. This took a hit on morale within the team and fans alike, alongside multiple double DNF’s that made many tifosi’s hearts break, including a double DSQ during the Chinese Grand Prix.</p>
         <h1>Statistics</h1>
         <img src="racefansdotnet-7106285_HiRes.jpg" alt="Pole Position">

        <br>
        <p>As mentioned, Ferrari came fourth in the 2025 Constructors’ Championship, ending the season on 398 points. Leclerc came 5th in the World Drivers’ Championship with 242 points with Hamilton coming in just below him at 6th with 156 points. Whilst Leclerc didn’t win any races, he secured 7 podiums for the Italian team, with his highest place finishes being second in Monaco and Mexico. Hamilton didn’t achieve any race wins or podiums in the 2025 season - his highest place finish was 4th. During the 2025 season, both Leclerc and Hamilton got a DHL Fastest Lap once. </p>
         <h1>The Drivers</h1>
        <br>
        <p>As we look back from the start of 2026, the Leclerc-Hamilton pairing was arguably the most anticipated duo in the history of the sport. One was the "Prince of Maranello," born and bred in the Ferrari system; the other was a seven-time World Champion seeking a final, historic chapter.</p>
         <h1>Charles Leclerc</h1>
         <img src="Leclerc-Cover-Thedriver.jpg" alt="Pole Position">
        <br>
        <p>Leclerc didn’t have the easiest start to the season following a P8 finish in Australia and a disqualification in China due to car weight breaches. In the next three races, Charles managed to finish in the top 5 before falling a bit down the ranks at Miami and Emilia-Romagna. Leclerc’s best result of the season came at his home race in Monaco - a P2 finish. Following this, he managed to get another three consecutive finishes within the top 5, before a 14th-place finish at Silverstone. In the majority of races after this, he finished in the top 10, other than at Zandvoort and São Paulo where he DNF. Leclerc proved to be the stronger driver throughout the season, earning Ferrari’s only podiums and finishing higher than his teammate most of the season.</p>
        <h1>Lewis Hamilton</h1>
         <img src="ico6g5d_lewis-hamilton_625x300_26_October_25.webp" alt="Pole Position">
        <br>
        <p>Lewis Hamilton joined Ferrari in 2025 after 12 years racing for Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula 1 Team. Like Leclerc, the start to his season wasn’t the easiest after a 10th-place finish in Australia and a disqualification in China due to car weight breaches, after winning the sprint race earlier in the weekend. He was performing in the midfield following this in what seemed like a difficult car to drive, but during the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix he managed to secure a 4th place finish - his highest of the season. Hamilton managed to repeat this result another three times, these being in Austria, then at his home race at Silverstone, and finally at COTA. Like his teammate, he DNF twice as well in Zandvoort and São Paulo. Hamilton described this season as a “nightmare”. The season proved to be very difficult, with him exiting Q1 three times in a row. What started as a dream pairing turned into his worst F1 season yet, securing no race wins or podiums.</p>
